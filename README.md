# Practice-Stats-Sheet-Parser
A practice project for working with the UnityEditor API. This lets you add ScriptableObjects to your project based on a CSV's contents. Created with Unity 2020.1 <br>

### Seeing It In Action
- Open the characterStats.csv in Assets/Resources
- Change any stats or class names you like. Feel free to even add more characters, though make sure all their fields are filled out
- Open the project in Unity 2020 or later
- Go to the Inspector for the CharacterLoader in Assets/Resources
- Click the button, and see how the Character Scriptable objects changed to match what's in the CSV.
- Delete said Scriptable Objects
- Have the characters loaded again, and see new ones take their place
- Feel free to change the CharacterLoader's path so you can see it load characters into other folders
- Keep playing around
